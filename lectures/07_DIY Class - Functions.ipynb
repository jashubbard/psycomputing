    "First, read Chapters 3 and 4 from ABSP to give yourself some background. I will provide a few examples here, then you should work on Homework 2 **IN CLASS**. **The homework will be due at the beginning of next class**, and we will go over the answers. This is ambitious. Just do your best, and if you get stuck on a problem explain why you are stuck. I want to see effort more than anything.  \n",

Someone makes a hammer in a factory, someone else buys that hammer and uses it to put hundreds or thousands of nails into things-- they don't need to make a new hammer each time, it's reusable. Functions are like hammers. \n",
